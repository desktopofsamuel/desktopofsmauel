## ðŸ’» Laptop: Macbook Pro 13" (late 2017)

Current version of Macbook Pro with touch bar is not the best MacBook I have ever used. It came with more powerful processing power and a barely useful touch bar. Yet, the experience  Still have lags on 4K videos on YouTube, graphic driver was not compatible to use Adobe Illustrator for months. Touchbar is barely useful to everyday work. I would have higher expectation to Appleâ€™s product.

## ðŸ“š Tablet: iPad Mini 5

I was excited the moment when i heard the rumors of new iPad mini. It was one of my fastest and not Rainer purchase decision ever. Goodbye to my iPad Mini 2 (which is a valuable gift from my internship) but it is too slow for any kind of serious work that I only use it for media consumption and book reading. With Apples generous offer to the latest mobile power to a previously entry-tier tablet model, it is definitely worth to try it as a daily driver. Review is coming soon.

## ðŸ“± Mobile Phone: iPhone 11 Pro

I switched to Android from iPhone 6S 2 years ago. It was a curious decision to know what Android feels like. I had a Nexus 5 way back but it never become my daily phone. Android offers so many customization and automation settings that I long for, and the deep Google service integration is my main reason to purchase a Pixel (which is still disappointingly not available for sell worldwide).

What's great about Pixel is the software. Although I experienced serious camera lag and even system slowdown in the first few months, Google solved these issues via their monthly updates. The flagship camera system is also about software as well. Low-light and HDR+ performance are the best in the market (when it was first launched).

## âŒš Watch: Apple Watch (1st gen)

The original generation Apple Watch is more durable than I thought. I have been using it for 5 years, which is longer than any of my Apple products. Yes it is unresponsive and slow but since I switched the Android, I barely it mainly for health tracking and time. Frankly speaking, in the times of less notification and interruptions in our daily life, I'm good living without notification on my wrist. I will miss the haptic feedback when phone calls though. 

On the good side, Google Fit recently launched the long-waited iOS version, so my heart rate data can be synced from Health app. Consolidated together with my Google Map stats on Google Fit. 

## ðŸŽ§ Headphone: Bose SoundSport Wireless

There is something wrong with my ear that I never get comfortable with in-ear headphones. There isn't many alternatives in the market and I have even considered using Airpod on Android. Luckily I found SoundSport Wireless is a unique solution to my problem. It supports connecting up to 3 devices at the same time and switches automatically if any devices play anything. There is a more expensive wireless option as well.
