Growing up with Hollywood movies and American TV dramas, I have been longing to visit the greatest city in the world and thatâ€™s partly why I decided to major in American Studies in HKU. My dream came true when I signed up for the field trip to Philadelphia & New York in 2014.

The only portrait I took was our tour guide. He was a living history book of the city. We followed him from Brooklyn Heights to Downtown Manhattan for hours, mesmerized by his many stories and oldies songs.
