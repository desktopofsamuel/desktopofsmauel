Grasscamp is an independent music festival organised by Lawnmap. Started in 2011 as a music event, it become a 3-day music camp held in the wild. I have been joining the camp since 2014 and greatly honoured to be one of the official photographers in 2016. Music next to the campfire is a yearly tradition of the festival.
