#### Israel, Palestine 2016

Jerusalem is the holy city of three religions in the world, Christianity, Judaism and Islam. We arrived the city at Yom Kippur, the holiest day in Jewish calendar. It's about atonement and seeking forgiveness for wrongs in a year. Cars are forbidden, streets are empty and people are in praying synagogue. It's also the most peaceful day I have been in a foreign city.
