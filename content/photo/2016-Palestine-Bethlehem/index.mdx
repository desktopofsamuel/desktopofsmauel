#### Palestine 2016


We arrived Bethlehem just a few hours before the border was shut down ahead of Yom Kippur. As tourists, we can cross the border easily while Palestinians require a permit to enter Jerusalem. Concrete walls and armed guards segregate the ruins and refugee camps in Bethlehem from the Holy City. We passed by a playground and we were told by our driver that the cans hanging on the net are tear gas canisters.
